# naive_bayes_f_pandas
A concise and performant implementation of the Nayes Bayes Classifier

This implementation utilizes Python fstrings and vectorized arithmetic to create
a minimal yet communicative implementation of the Nayes Bayes Classifier.  This is
accomplished by explicity spelling out Bayes Theorum with the dictionary keys.  The
implementation is complete, but there's more to come in the near future.
